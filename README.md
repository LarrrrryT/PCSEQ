EQ visualizer

Is an animated EQ visualizer that can be used for audio ios applications.  

How to use: 

```
PCSEQVisualizer* eq = [[PCSEQVisualizer alloc]initWithNumberOfBars:20];
[self.view addSubview:eq];
[eq start];
```

To pause the EQ call:

```
[eq stop];
```

I will try to update this code to handle audio output such as treble and bass
